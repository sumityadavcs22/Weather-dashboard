## Frontend

The frontend of this 


project is meticulously crafted using React, a powerful JavaScript library. It serves as the backbone of the application, handling routing and rendering of multiple sub-components, including the visually appealing dashboard page, welcoming page, and the intuitive login/register pages. These pages are thoughtfully designed utilizing a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an engaging and seamless user experience.

To fetch data from the Weather API and interact with the MongoDB database, the project leverages the Axios library. Axios provides a convenient and efficient way to make GET/POST requests, facilitating the retrieval and manipulation of data in a secure manner. By integrating Axios, the frontend seamlessly communicates with the backend, enabling smooth data exchange between the application and external APIs.

## Backend

The backend of this project is built using Express.js and Node.js, serving as a robust bridge between the React frontend and the database. It enables seamless communication and facilitates the retrieval of weather data by leveraging Express's powerful GET/POST functionality.

For efficient data storage and management, the project utilizes a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The database consists of two collections: "Active Users" for currently logged-in users and "Registered Users" for storing details of registered users like name, email, password, and city.
